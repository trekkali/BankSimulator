# Bank simulator
This program is a simulation of a bank account management system carried out in Python. It allows users to perform various banking operations such as creating accounts, making withdrawals, deposits, and checking balances.

When you launch the program, you are greeted with a main menu displaying different options. You can choose from these options by entering the number corresponding to the operation you wish to perform.

If you choose to create an account, the program asks you to provide a username and password. A random account number is then generated and saved to a text file with the account information.

Withdrawal and deposit functions allow users to manipulate their account balance by providing their account number and password. If the information is correct and the balance is sufficient for a withdrawal, the amount is withdrawn from the balance. Likewise, for a payment, the amount is added to the balance.

The lookup feature allows users to check their account balance by providing their account number and password. If the information is correct, the current balance is displayed to the user.

After each operation, the user has the option to return to the main menu to perform further operations or to exit the program.

This project allowed me to strengthen my Python programming skills, notably using functions, loops, file manipulation and user interactions through an interactive menu.
